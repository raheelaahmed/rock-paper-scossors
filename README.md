# Welcome to [Rock-Paper-Scissors!](https://raheelaahmed.github.io/rock-paper-scossors/)


Rock-Paper-Scissors is a classic hand game enjoyed by people of all ages. I have created this game for computers and mobiles. It's a single-player game where you compete against the computer. I've provided buttons for you to choose your move (rock, paper, or scissors), and the computer picks its move randomly.
