# Welcome to [Rock-Paper-Scissors!](https://raheelaahmed.github.io/rock-paper-scossors/)


Rock-Paper-Scissors is a classic hand game enjoyed by people of all ages. I have created this game for computers and mobiles. It's a single-player game where you compete against the computer. I've provided buttons for you to choose your move (rock, paper, or scissors), and the computer picks its move randomly.


 
 







## Rock Paper Scissors:

The page body has a background picture, a game heading, a game area and reload button in the center of the page.




### Heading:

At the top of the page, there is a logo or heading.




### Game Area:

#### Score:


In this game area, there are "Player Score:" and "Computer Score:". Scores will be displayed in front of them once they earn a score, and the scores will keep increasing with every round they win.



#### Moves Left:

Below the scores, there are "Total 10 Moves," which will decrease with every round. When the number of moves left reaches 0, the game ends.



#### Button:


There are three buttons: "Rock, Paper, and Scissors." The player will choose a button of their choice to play the game. The buttons will turn yellow with a CSS hover effect when the mouse goes over them, and will also work on mobile devices with a click.

#### Computer Choice:

The computer randomly picks "Rock, Paper, or Scissors" and displays its choice.


#### Round Result:


The result is displayed at the end of every round. It can be a computer win, a player win, or a tie.














#### Reload:
 
At the bottom of the page, there's a reload button. Clicking it will restart the game.


#### How To Play:
There is a "How To Play" button at the bottom of the page. Clicking the button displays a popup box that explains the game rules and instructions. Double-clicking the popup makes it disappear. This functionality works on touchscreens as well.

## Game Over and Winner:

The game has a limited number of moves. When there are no moves left (moves left reach 0), the game ends, and the final result is displayed.

## Responsive Design:

The website has a responsive design, meaning it adjusts to different screen sizes.

## Lanuguages:
I built this website using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.



## Credits:
I used W3Schools to choose background colors and a YouTube video for guidance with JavaScript (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jeHs213y-A). I also used AI to help fix the code for double-clicking on touchscreens.



## Fonts and Icons:
 Google font are used for styling the website.

## Bugs andFixes:

I was having problem with responsiveness of my web design and i solved my problem using "html Media Quries".
I was having trouble setting the background image for the body. It wasn't working in my CSS file, but using the style attribute in HTML is working now.
I was having trouble with double clicks registering on mobile screens. I fixed this by using the touchstart function in JavaScript.









## Browser Testing:
I tested my website on several browsers, including Chrome and Safari, and it's working fine.
